A Backend Engineer & Machine Learning Enthusiast focused on building **API-first platforms**, deploying ML models as **intelligent services**, and creating **semantic search systems** using **LLMs + Vector Databases**.

From deploying event ticketing APIs to exploring LangChain, Pinecone, and DRF integrations, I’m figuring out best practices to **bridge ML and backend systems**—with clean, scalable, real-world tools.

## ✨ Experience
🔬 Graduate Researcher — Chemical Engineering
University of Alabama

As part of my graduate research, I’ve been working at the intersection of machine learning and computational catalysis, applying neural networks to accelerate quantum simulations:

🧠 Trained neural interatomic potentials (MLIPs) from scratch using architectures like NequIP and Allegro

🔁 Fine-tuned foundational MLIP models such as:

MACE – for active learning-based adsorption energy prediction

ORB – for domain adaptation and low-data enhancement and co adsorption of CO and NO modelling

⚙️ Automated data generation and labeling pipelines using ASE, VASP, and uncertainty sampling

📈 Benchmarked model performance using metrics like force RMSE, adsorption energy trends, and RDF comparisons

One powerful insight I gained during this work:
Unlike many general-purpose ML models, MLIPs can be directly served as calculators within simulation software like ASE, making them highly integrable into real-world scientific workflows.

This sparked a deeper curiosity for me — realizing that ML models aren’t just meant to predict, but to be served, consumed, and scaled like any other software system.

## 🚧 From MLIPs to ML APIs
Now I’m connecting training models to serving models. I’m particularly exploring:

⚙️ Model-to-API pipelines for deploying ML predictions via FastAPI & DRF

🔎 Semantic search systems powered by LLMs + vector databases

🔄 How to continuously embed and ingest new data in real-time into a vector store (Pinecone, FAISS) to improve retrieval and RAG pipelines

💡 Exploring LangChain, document loaders, and scalable vector search to support intelligent app interfaces

This blend of scientific modeling and API-first engineering defines how I think about machine learning today — not just research, but production-grade intelligence.

## 🧭 Currently Learning

- MLOps toolchains: Celery, Flower, Redis, Model versioning
- LLM + Vector DB integration in API design
- Semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Multi-tenant SaaS API patterns

🎓 **ALX Pro Backend Engineering Program** — Using this to deepen production knowledge (DRF, GraphQL, Celery, scalability patterns)
